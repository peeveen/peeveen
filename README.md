### About me
* I have been interested in software development since I was a kid, wondering "how does this work?" while playing games on my Atari 2600.
* I tend to pick up new technologies fairly quickly. I've seen enough over the years to flatten most learning curves.
* Lately I have become very interested in CI/CD and automation/streamlining of development processes.
