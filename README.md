### Personal statements
* I have been a professional software developer for approximately 30 years, with an appetite for solving problems and making things work well, with a particular focus on streamlining and automating working practices, and creating re-usable components and projects.
* I tend to pick up new technologies fairly quickly. I've seen enough over the years to flatten most learning curves. I may not be au-fait with the exact set of technologies that you use, but Iâ€™m pretty confident I can handle it.
* I have been interested in software development since I was a kid, wondering "how does this work?" while playing games on my Atari 2600.
